\abstract{This paper introduces the hypergraph transversal problem along with the following iterative solutions: naive, branch and bound, and dynamic exponential time (NC-D). Odometers are introduced along with the functions that manipulate them. The traditional definitions of hyperedge, hypergraph, etc., are redefined in terms of odometers and lists. All algorithms and functions necessary to implement the solution are presented along with techniques to validate and test the results. Lastly, parallelization  advanced applications, and future research directions are examined.
